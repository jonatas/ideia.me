  Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Staff Engineer and Developer Advocate with 20+ years of experience 
  specializing in database optimization, system architecture, and breaking down monoliths 
  for large-scale applications. At Timescale, I've helped hundreds of developers optimize 
  their PostgreSQL and time-series data solutions. I'm passionate about empowering teams 
  through better tools, knowledge sharing, and fostering engineering communities where 
  everyone can thrive. My work spans from building open-source tools like fast and 
  timescaledb-ruby to speaking at 30+ international conferences and mentoring 300+ 
  developers worldwide.
