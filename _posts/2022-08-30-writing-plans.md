I'm starting this "writing plan" as a way to encourage myself to write more
at my blog and keep practicing putting my thoughts out there.

My idea is work on three different categories to just keep practively sharing
things about my expertise and learnings.

In the last few years I stuck a bit on sharing, and even now, it's being hard to
prolific write and dump my thoughts on the web. Now, I'm tryng to commit myself
by writing this blog post.

When I started this text, the name was only calendar.md and I was not sure if
I'd dump the blog text titles in my calendar directly.

I dediced to have full domain of my plan and use a plain text instead of events
with a proposed date ready.

Afraid of commiting to a date, I keep escaping from the idea to be commited to
myself and share my thoughts. The thoughs I have are the only property that
nobody can take from me.

My experiences makes me this unique perspective from the world, that only the
perceptions from my world can prove.

My past, my feelings, my context. What I did and how I did. Every action rolls
out a new future of our life. If I don't write now, probably I'll not write
later. If I don't write tomorrow, probably I'll not write next week.

We need to practice to get a real taste of everything we want.

This are the common arguments that makes me feel good about the decision to
write.

Today I'm commiting myself to try to open a space on my agenda and make it for
writing. I'm always trying to spend a good time thinking but I don't too many
opportunities to share it with friends either find someone interested in hearing
me. Yes, writing is for these kind of lonely people that need to write to the
walls and publish their thoughts to other people that will may read it or not.

Writing is like blindly speak, you don't know if someone is really hearing you.
You don't know if it makes effect on the readers and what will make them reply
to you or give some feedback about it.

I always advocate that if I write I can always use it as a power. A source that
proves I already dedicated time to think about something.

I'm very often learning and thinking about communication, our language and how
we interact as species. What is the human behaviour and how people become excellent.
Through several layers of evolution, everyone needs to work out to evolve in what
they want.

If you aspire to excel in some activity, you'll need to go harder as the best of their areas are. Nobody is special and only the exercise
will make it improve. If things are easy and you're talented on that area, you
can work out in other areas and keep evolving as a whole.

We can always develop ourselves. I love communication and I'd like to master on
this topic. To be productive about learning and improving my communication, I
decided to write my communication. It allows me to validate my thoughts and
easily sort and quailify the importance of my words as I speak.

I'm often going back and forth and moving chunks of my writings to build a
better story. I often cut off parts that does not make sense. Should I talk
about this? Is it the right moment? Am I diffusing from the target communication?
What is the target? Should I need to just follow a single target?

While I write about my plannings and how to write, I mix my feelings wether I'm
putting the words in the right place. Qualify and choose what should be where is
one of the hardest thing during the writing phase.

I keep suppressing myself and sometimes stuck on writing just because I don't
have courage enough to say what I want to say. I shut up myself just for the
sake of nothing. Judging that I don't have the right words or I don't have
anything important to say.

Instead of silence, communicate. Nobody has your point of view. If you think it
can be useful to someone else in the world, say it, write it. Speak about it and
pay attention on your own discourse. See the composition of words that you use
for communicating and start qualifying the accuracy of the word with your real
intention.

Here are my criterias to reword the text:

1. Am I merchandizing/lying/not sure here?
2. Am I talking about the subject or giving my personal opinion?
3. Am I deprecating other people's opinion?
4. Am I biased? Can I use more specific words?

I love to preserve my right of editing what I think. In the end, more I think,
deeper I go and better words I'll have for writing.

Two minutes after starting this section I did several rewordings to make it more
engaging to read. Also, to make it more precise.

If you have true attention on what you're reading, probably your mind is engaged
in what comes next as mine. And this is the difference of plain attention and
interest than random processing the meaning of some words in sequence.

Sometimes I feel my writings are made to nobody. I feel no one really cares about
what I write and maybe this text will never reach someone. Do you see my ability
of mixing my personal feelings, thoughts and describing behavior?

You can have several guesses talking about the effects of your message, but to
master on communication means you'll need to target your message to some specific
audience. Re-read the text thinking like them, wearing their hat. Then, reword
to match their communication style.

Making an average of your writings will make you reach the average. If you're
not interested in the average, then you can write freely and simply loose most
part of your readers because the lack of interest of because you haven't matched
your audience objectives.

Even if your audience is really curious about you, mixing your ideas during your
writings will really difuse the attention of your audience.

Think about the text that you're reading now. It started with the promise of a
guy to get back writing, mixing his feelings and thoughts about communication
with the promise of communicating.

The title is undefined and the filename is `calendar.md`. I'll probably rename
it to `writing-calendar` or `writing commitment`.

If I need to put a sub-title on this section, I'd probably use **meta writing**
inspired by the `meta programming` concept. As it reminds me that it's a recursive
objectives to reflect about the subject.

The subject is very clear in my mind. It's **writing about writing**. Because it's a
profession. There are professional writers everywhere and maybe I can become
one.

Practicing is the key to start and here is my very first boldly verbosed
discourse that works as a promise that I'll commit to write more.

## Topics

My plan is use the blog for sharing knowledge, thoughts and ideas. Here is my
outline of the subjects I'd like to talk, which I hope to be updating frequently,
especially to add links for the topics I'm publishing.

In the bottom of this file, you can find a **Updates** section with all my
future edits and you can also watch them one by one at the
[ideia.me](https://github.com/jonatas/ideia.me.git).

I plan to write small posts that I can publish often and target people that have
a short span of attention. This is also atomic tips that can be split and reused
from bigger context. They will work in both ways, often being the seed and
inspiration to go further and work on larger topics.

#### Tools

I love terminal and years pass and the shell is still very present on my life.
I still edit the stuff on vim and use shell scripts for my automation. I'll be
sharing short posts about my time-saver tools'.

Planned posts here are:
* psql tips and tricks
* how to use Timescale

#### Programming Researches and Projects

I don't code that often, but I'd like to document the progress of interests
like:

* ****Abstract Syntax Tree****: I'm often exploring my desire of adapting
[ffast](https://github.com/jonatas/fast) to work with SQL. My adventures and
challenges adapting fast is a thing that will be my log and research about how
it's done and how I'm going to improve this thing.
* **Datasets**: I'm often looking for the open datasets to explore with Timescale.
* **Time series dataset**: what if I turn X into a timeseries dataset? I'm often
    exploring new ideas of turning information into timeseries data.

#### Personal wins

I quit drinking several years ago, then became vegetarian, and finally I quit
smoking. I'm now living with less anxiety and more self awareness. Yoga,
medidation, calming down and using my consciousnes changed my life completely.

1. How addiction affected my life?
2. How co-dependencies can drive your friendship and relationship?
3. Thoughts about my seamless switch my ergodox keyboard to macbook without that
   many typos?

#### Thoughts

* **leadership**: I'm always reflecting about the leader attributes and how to find
    my way to always be a good leader at work and compassionate with myself.
* **communication**: I love the communication design'. How people architect the
    message and create good content driving the reader with an exciting message.
* **career**: I hope to dump several thoughts about career as I spend most part of
    my life working. If I cannot stop to reason about it, I'm probably a slave.
* **memories from my old days**: back to the young me and be conscious about the
     mental model upgrades.
* **interviewing**: I was often involved on interviewing people and recruiting is
     always something that catches my attention. I specially love to analyse the
     communication from recruiters and how they sell the job opportunities.
     I'm often trying to optimize my communication with them and have all clear
     trasparency about what opportunities I'm open to. I often skip the why I'm not open/interested on their invites, instead I
     just say I'm not interested. I eventually outline the reasons in my mind
     and probably it would worth to share with them.
* **writing better CV**: I'm always reviwing my friends CVs' and helping them to
     better describe their past experience. How to qualify the experiences in a
     way that they can be interesting and engaging to learn about their past.
     This is communication optimization and also involves a lot of review self
     knowledge and how we should prioritize ourselves.

* tech jobs and roles: what you can do and what every IT profession does?
* future: what will happen with the professions from now
* plans: work on what you need not what you want

#### Priorities

Life is short. I'm always valuating if I'm using my time properly.

I often get myself deeply thinking about my priorities and commitment. Because
of that I think about go deeper into prioritization.

* how to sort the things you need to do?
* cleaning up your priorities list.
* rewording and reclassifying your priorities.
* setting up rules for planning and execution.

### Onboarding

I'm glad that I got involved with the employee experience. I welcomed hundreds
of people in the last few years. I'm often engaging my friends to do the same
and expose the opportunities in the onboarding domain as a new category of
challenges that fast growing companies are facing when they start hiring
aggressively.

* **empathy**: how can I provoke emotions in the old hands to welcome newcomers with
    compassion. Later, how can I proactively drive newcomers with compassion?
    encourage them to support and build solid bridges and a trustful connection?
* **structure**: how to organize the onboarding activities to build a solid program
    that can be easy to learn and bond real connection with team members?
* **encouragement**: how to unlock newcomers bias and let them develop healthy
    habits to not get affected by the impostor syndrome?
* **being yourself**: convincing yourself about your identity and improving your
    power by respecting your nature. How to conquer confidence to just expose
    your ideas with no fear?
* **activities**: ideas to try with newcomers and old hands. Programs that you can
    build at your company and practical exercises you can try with your team to
    build up more connection and knowledge sharing.
