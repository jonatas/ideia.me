I tried to have a restrospective moment every year and it always happen in the
last few days of December.

I love to reflect and understand what makes me strong/weak and how I can move
forward with more accurate attitudes.

Last year, I finished my year celebrating my anniversary at RubyConf Thailand.

![rubyconf-thailand-birthday]

I got a cake in the end of my talk and the entire conference sung happy birthday
to me! It was a legendary moment in my life!

First time I put my feet in India, Canada and Mexico. I'm skipping my layover in Morocco :)

## PGConf India 2023

This year was far the year that I traveled more in my career. My first stop was
very far from home, I'm so happy that I went to India for PGConf. I had a full
crowded room and it was an intensive 4 hours workshop.

![pgconf-india-pannel]

I had a 4-hour workshop answering questions with data around the the theme
"Is global warming real?".

The idea behind this workshop was introduce me in the Postgres basic data science
and [serve my community](/serve-your-community).

I'm very happy that this introductory workshop for beginners was very well
accepted in almost all conferences I sent. It seems several times people are
struggling to get a spot and speak in a conference and sometime just serving the
community with the basics can be a very welcome action.

![pgconf-india-talk]

I loved India and I'd easily live there. The food is amazing, people are
humble, happy and peaceful. I'd love to get out of Bengalaru and travel more.


![pgconf-india-friends]

I also had the opportunity to meet several folks that works for Timescale. It
was amazing. So glad to know more about these folks cultural aspects! Precious
moments with them ðŸ«¶

![pgconf-india-dinner]

My second trip was the longest of the year. In 40 days I did `Spain -> US -> Mexico -> Canada -> Poland -> Brazil`.

## Scale 20x

In march I went to SCaLE 20x â€“ the 20th Annual Southern California Linux Expo.

My first timem in Pasadena/Los Angeles area. Great names like Ken Thomposon was
also speaking in the conference. I had great time there, and my talk was about
psql tips and tricks. You can watch it [here](https://youtu.be/4Q4jOmHbDvU?si=FbNIjtS6HJMQzUq4).

I also meet Cliff, this guy!

![scale-with-cliff]

I love meeting new people and that's the most amazing part of community. Cliff is
an example of courage and we had great time talking about career, life and
everything.

I went to Santa Monica in my free time and it was an amazing trip using public
transport. The most important thing was my memories on Forest Gump movie coming
real in front of Bubba Gump restaurant.

## JOnTheBeach - MÃ¡laga - 2023

In Spain I had two workshops and
my talk was about how to model a time series database, [watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd6w10Z2YYc).

[JOnTheBeach conference](https://www.jonthebeach.com). This conference was amazing,
very well structured and with outstanding talks.

![jonthebeach-workshop]

I was very impressed with the amount of gaming companies focused on Casinos was
in the area. The city seems a great place to live and work with tech and this
conference is a real proof of it.

Between conferences, sometimes it does not worth to get back home and you can
chose a long stay. My time in Malaga was the longest stay as my next stop would
be more expensive.

![running-malaga]

I loved the city and I ran almost 60 km during my 12 days there. I did my
longest run of the year of 17 km. Almost jogging but was a new achievement!


# Bitcoin Miami

Timescale was sponsoring Bitcoin Miami one week before the marketing offsite in
Mexico, so I had the opportunity to arrive early and meet my teammates and work
with them during 3 days of conference.

![btc-folks]

How much I love these folks! Team work is all about embracing the challenges and
grow together. We had a very intensive opportunity to train our short pitches
about Timescale to an audience spectrum from crypto folks that was mind blowing
to me.

![btc-booth]

We attract a lot of folks to our booth. Funny communication experience. It's always
a great exercise to find ways to explain how a timeseries database can make your
business better no matter what you're doing.

![btc-selfie]

BTC Miami is a real show of what crypto folks can do. The conference has
too many arts installed and a small museum with all hashing hardware. Too many
companies with specialized hardware for hashing. I loved to being back a little
and see how much powerful is the finance/fintech/crypto ecosystem.

# Mexico

I had a short time in Mexico but it was fun! I had the opportunity to visit Isla Mujeres
and other paradisiac places nearby. I did a little dive to a place with
underwater giantic sculptures closer to an Island. It was a mind blowing
experience.

![selfie-cancun]

The offsite was really great! It's always great to meet folks in person,
especially in full remote environment. I'd never get back on feed on office full
time but the offsites really worth going. Great times to build trust, work and
have fun!

Had the opportunity to meet the legendary [@noctarius2k](https://twitter.com/noctarius2k),
Java Champion which become a Developer Advocate at Timescale too!

## PGCon 2023 - Toronto

PGCon was certainly the most low level coding conference I went in my life.

![pgcon-shirt]

I love how profound and very intentional is this conference. They want to meet to
really talk and solve complex problems. Even Tom Lane and other folks from the
Postgres origins were there. I loved how they brough all discussions and
used break out rooms to get hands dirty or discuss things in the board grouped by challenges.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And the <a href="https://twitter.com/PGCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PGCon</a> is over! It was the most deeply technical conference ever for me! <br><br>My data science workshop went well but I originally thought nobody would join due to the complexities of the other topics, in the end I got an audience! Glad that it worked :) <a href="https://t.co/2ltAqncYmt">pic.twitter.com/2ltAqncYmt</a></p>&mdash; JÃ´natas Davi Paganini (@jonatasdp) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonatasdp/status/1664742275535056896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Toronto with a shorter time, but I also had the
opportunity to show my [AI experiments](https://jonatas.github.io/timescaledb/chat_gpt_tutorial/).
and all the fun I'm having  with it.

![pgcon-folks]

I also had the opportunity to meet the amazing Jacob Champion which is a open
source developer during his entire life. Worked on libcurl and other great
projects like Postgres ðŸ˜±

## Lambda Days - 2023

My second time in Poland. I love this place and I'm so grateful that I had  the
opportunity to visit Krakow and RzeszÃ³w again!

I'm a functional programming fan even I never did anything really serious
professionally. My talk is available online and you can watch it if you want.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How to bring the power of functional programming to the database level? Learn from <a href="https://twitter.com/jonatasdp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jonatasdp</a> - his talk from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LambdaDays?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LambdaDays</a> 2023 is available on our YT:<a href="https://t.co/BqdjcoRTKD">https://t.co/BqdjcoRTKD</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PostgreSQL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PostgreSQL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/functionalprogramming?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#functionalprogramming</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/PostgreSQL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PostgreSQL</a> <a href="https://t.co/XBY67HbSQN">pic.twitter.com/XBY67HbSQN</a></p>&mdash; Lambda Days (@LambdaDays) <a href="https://twitter.com/LambdaDays/status/1721883758616617214?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

My talk on LambdaDays was a small guided tour for the the functional folks to take a look on the
timescaledb toolkit pipeline operator. I love this topic and feel glad to be
with them.

I also made new friends and had the opportunity to be part of a careers panel.
Very good conversation and to get closer to the functional programming community.
Amazing community, very inclusive. I learned a lot from these folks!

![lambda-days-friends]

After Lambda Days I spent a few times with my old colleagues from previous
company. Marcin and Michal are like my brothers. I feel at home in their home.

Lovely friends from Poland!

![michal-marcin]

Michal Papis was also one of the maintainers of RVM (Ruby Version Manager) which
was a very widely adopted tool.

I went very far with Marcin and Michal talking about programming and the new
era coming with AI.

My last talk of the trip was in RzeszÃ³w two days before coming back home. Second
time there, with the meetup organized by my friend
[Maciek RzÄ…sa](https://twitter.com/mjrzasa).

## PG Days

Back to Brazil, I had the opportunity to speak at 6 PGDays in Brazil, going to
BrasÃ­lia, SÃ£o Paulo, Belo Horizonte, ChapecÃ³, Porto Alegre.

The Postgres Community in Brazil skipped the PGConf this year and spread out
dozens of PGDays instead. I absolutely loved it as the single day event reached
people in a more inclusive manner, not only bringing professionals but also
introducing Postgresql in universities.

I specially had great times with folks from this picture:

Fabrizio Mello from Timescale (Timbira boss), Alvaro from Stackgres, Charlie Baptista from Perconna.

![bh-folks]

## House

Permaculture is one of my objective in life. Reach a good balance with nature
and find a good way of living in harmony with all beings. Finally installed
solar panels and started setting up all my IoT system for the house.

I realized a big dream of having a dome as a green house. I built a few geodesic
structures in the past with chopsticks and using 3D printed connectors. I loved
how it feels. Then I decided to go build and pay a professional dome builder to make
the hard work for me.

![dome]

We also have a lots of bananas and other fruits going on the orchad. Building a
solar drier is one of my next projects as wood work is being one of my favorite
hobbies too.

![bananas]

I have too many other stuff to share but I was not disciplined enough to make
all time for it.
I had great time also building fornitures and other wood projects. A lot of fun!
