Thursday night, I arrived from Athens and past weekend I had the most insightful
update in my mindset until now. I'll refer here as semantic fields.

The main idea of semantic fields rules important aspects of our brain, and mixed
with a group of words floating on a multi-dimensional space.
Our beliefs are clustered by some key aspect of the communication,
given understanding of what each word means on a context.

Let's dive into some practical examples. What cold means? If you ask it for a
person in a tropical country, the temperature will vary from 10 to 20 Celsius
degrees is already cold. While for non-tropical folks, answers will vary too.

Cold is a valuation, a belief that someones has about some experience they have.
If you throw a tropicalist into a ice bath,Â they'll not die, it will just expand
the semantic field for the meaning of cold. I had exactly this experience by
jumping into a lake in Athens and it as 9 Celsius degrees outside.

If you just distrust your valuation system (be careful, don't die), you'll end
up opening and expanding your thoughts to a new system that can distrust and
revalidate it, recursively expanding it the infinite.

Distrusting all your beliefs is hard because you need to throw your entire
memory system in the trash and burn calories to reprocess everything all the time.
It costs energy and time but here is the magic to feel alive.

Stop giving same answers, think about all words, use active listening all the time,
and **never ever hurt anyone** with words or thoughts because it's all about learning
more about your own annoying brain.

I'm a big fan of conscientiology studies and I fall in love with my partner
after spending a night at her apartment, craving to see all her books but just
stuck over the consentiongram. It's a book/resume with several questions to
score levels of conscious to all aspects of your life and valuate yourself
on your self conscious journey.

The neovocabluary proposed by the conscientiology studies expanded my capacity
of reasoning. Understanding new semantic connections leverages the speed of
acquiring complex subjects through different fields.

During the last few years I'm practicing fast listening through any media I can.
Depending the density of the subject, I can easily go with 3x and still get
bored and often feel I got nothing new out of it.

The problem of being superficial and avoid expanding knowledge with
neovocabularies is that you're forced to keep surrounding the
topic because the lack of words. My daily shame to find the right word in English
is fadding out as I work out on my muscle memory and speed up my process
reinforcing new vocabularies varying on exotic topics.

I'm so pleased that now I feel my brain just using faster switches between 
different semantic contexts to build communication as RAG (Retrieval-Augmented-Generation) bless us
exploring the knowledge of all our languages together. Chains are interconnecting
new synapses faster than I ever experienced.

My next steps exploring these topics is to discover the new limits for the
beliefs that affects my mind more often. My first curiosity and research goes
over the construction of a pragmatic process to help therapists to build custom
models/neovocabularies to their patients.

My own research to find a therapist online was a profound struggle. Filtering
near by therapists in the internet led me to a large group of professionals with
a very shallow and repetitive vocabulary that never ever caught my attention
either "spoke my language". My theory is that the attraction
of forces, especially on intentional relationships, like go to a therapy or buy a
product, is highly magnetized by the semantic field match.

a buyer/seller in general, are ruled by this semantic fields that can
fields are attracted magnetized bringing an alignment with the patient belief.

Neuro-marketing is spreading alternative messages to see what hooks the
masses. Brands are massively taking over this techniques as as holy books did
in the past with religions, they'll keep the main message simple and introduce
neovocabularies later, as gifts of knowledge for avid members.

Memorizing names and going deep into new concepts and vocabularies needs energy
and movement and remember that inertia rules the universe.

My self-commitment is to be in movement, being present in time as the most
incredible human to everything that orbits around me.
I'm ready to have a closer relationship with the nature, and also my nature,
fearlessly investigating anything that stops me from this commitment, being humble,
vulnerable, ready for change, ready for the future.

This is my own neo-vocabulary, a space I'm opening for health and abundant living.
Words for my own cure, building blocks that can feed my mind and believe in a better world.

I love books and how they expand my vocabulary and mindset.

I'm now on "Can't Hurt Me" from David Goggins is master on semantic fields of
discipline, giving up on all body pain to find new limits of the mind.

Here's a list of last few books that are highly correlated to the mindshift I'm having now:

* Man's search for meaning
* You're the placebo
* 700 Conscientiology Experiments
* Moral Decision Making
* Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman!
* When breathe becomes air
* Limiteless
* Dopamination
