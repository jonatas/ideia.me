Yes, one of the most potent substances I've ever used.

I have to admit it: I'm addicted to programming.

For so long, I tried to pretend it was just a developer's passion, but no: **I'm completely hooked**.

And worse, when I'm spending hours with quality code, I can't let go. I stay up all night "on the trip."

Even worse is when things don't work as expected. That's when it becomes most addictive. It's all too easy to see the sunrise when I'm debugging :)

## The Arrival of New Substances

In 2016, when I wrote the [original version](/programar-e-uma-droga) of this post, it was already difficult to stop coding. But now, in March 2025, with the arrival of AI tools, it's as if we've discovered a new class of engagement.

**The Cursor editor and its AI assistants make me feel like I have superpowers.**

What used to take hours to implement, I can now do in minutes. It's like having a pair programming partner available 24 hours a day.

Just imagine the sensation:
- Write a thought in natural language
- Watch it transform into functional code right before your eyes
- Ask for explanations about complex parts and receive clear answers
- Refactor old code with just a few commands

This isn't just programming - it's programming augmented by artificial intelligence. A completely new and even more addictive experience.

## The "Just One More Feature" Syndrome

When I started, I thought it would be easy to quit and that it was just a phase.

Young guy, full of energy, but no: Years down the road, even with my wife and child waiting, I'm still the same:

Waiting for the family to go to sleep so I can get one more coding fix.

And now, with Cursor, I always have the feeling that I can do "just one more little thing" before bed. The speed at which I can solve problems has made the programming experience even more immersive.

## Refactoring with a Single Command

One of the things that makes modern tools most addictive is how easy refactoring has become. With Cursor and AI assistants like Claude, I can:

- Explain in plain English what I want to change
- See intelligent suggestions on how to improve my code
- Apply complex changes with just a few commands
- Find bugs before even running the code

It's like having a reviewer, a mentor, and a pair programmer, all at the same time.

## Exploring Code at High Speed

Code navigation has also gained superpowers. With semantic searches and context understanding, I can:

- Find relevant parts of the code just by explaining what I'm looking for
- Understand new codebases much faster
- Navigate between related files without losing context
- Discover patterns that would be difficult to notice manually

## The Dose is Getting Stronger

The improvements I've made to my website in recent months have also been powered by these new tools. From enhanced syntax highlighting to automatic post categorization systems - everything became easier with AI assistance.

Check out this code snippet I implemented to suggest categories for posts based on content:

```javascript
function suggestCategories(title, content, currentCategories) {
  // Intelligent content analysis to suggest appropriate categories
  // ...
}
```

The code above is just a sample of the type of automation I've implemented on the site, making the writing experience much more fluid.

## There's No Cure Anymore

If I was addicted to programming before, now with all these AI tools like GPT, Claude, and the Cursor editor, my condition has only worsened.

The sensation of solving complex problems, creating new features, and automating processes has been elevated to another level.

And you know what the best part is? Seeing all this code executing, solving real problems, making systems more efficient.

So there it is: I confess that I'm addicted to programming. And now, with AI as my copilot, I'm in the worst phase of this addiction - and I don't want treatment.

**Programming is a drug. And with AI, the dose is even more potent.**
