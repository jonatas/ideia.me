Today marks my fourth anniversary at Timescale, and what an incredible journey it has been! As I reflect on these years, I'm filled with gratitude for the opportunities, challenges, and growth I've experienced. Let me share some highlights of my journey.

## The Beginning: A New Chapter

I joined Timescale in April 2021, stepping into a role that would combine my passion for PostgreSQL with the exciting world of time-series data. My first weeks were filled with learning and adapting to the Timescale culture, which I documented in my [first week](https://ideia.me/my-first-week-at-timescale) and [first month](https://ideia.me/my-first-month-at-timescale) blog posts.

## Technical Achievements

When transitioning from engineering to marketing, I learned that most achievements aren't purely technical but rather involve simplifying complex topics for our fellow developers.

Over these four years, most of my work has focused on content creation, delivering talks, creating demos, writing blog posts, hosting webinars,
and providing [numerous examples](https://github.com/jonatas/sql-snippets) and [templates](https://github.com/timescale/templates).
I've also dedicated significant time to engaging with our [communities](https://www.timescale.com/community), responding to hundreds of comments and questions.

In my spare time, I still love to hack code. Here are some exciting projects I'm proud to share:

1. **TimescaleDB Ruby Gem**: Contributing to the development and maintenance of the official Ruby gem for TimescaleDB, making it easier for Ruby developers to work with time-series data. I'm proud that I started this project out of my love for Ruby, not because it was requested. It now receives contributions from Timescale customers and includes advanced features like [hierarchical continuous aggregates](https://ideia.me/hierarchical-continuous-aggregates-with-ruby) and [customizing multiple refreshes](https://ideia.me/customize-multiple-refreshes-continuous-aggregates).

2. **Fast supports SQL Code**: It's like grep but for AST, allowing you to [grep SQL Code like a boss](/grepping-sql-code-like-a-boss).

## Public Speaking Journey

One of the most rewarding aspects of my career has been sharing knowledge with the global tech community. Over the past four years, I've had the incredible opportunity to speak at numerous conferences and events across the world.

2023 was my most active year, and I delivered 33 talks :)

Here's a summary of my speaking engagements:

### Conference Statistics (2021-2025)

- **Countries Visited**: 12 (Brazil, Thailand, India, Poland, Canada, USA, Spain, and more)

## Embracing Timescale Values

If I can offer a single piece of advice to anyone changing careers or looking for a new company, it would be to ensure you're very aligned with the company's values.

At Timescale, if you visit our [careers](https://www.timescale.com/careers) page, you'll see these core values:

1. **Get sh*t done**: We focus on delivering results and making things happen. This value has driven me to consistently ship features, write documentation, and contribute to our open-source projects.

2. **Be direct, with respect**: We communicate clearly and honestly while maintaining mutual respect. This approach has helped me build strong relationships with team members and community members alike.

3. **Embrace the challenge**: We see obstacles as opportunities for growth. Whether it's debugging complex performance issues or learning new technologies, this mindset has been crucial in my journey.

4. **Absolutely own the outcome**: We take full responsibility for our work and its impact. This value has guided me in ensuring the quality and reliability of our Ruby integrations and database tools.

5. **Be excellent but humble**: We strive for technical excellence while maintaining humility. This balance has helped me both contribute meaningfully to the PostgreSQL ecosystem and learn from others in the community.

6. **Win together**: We believe in collective success. This value is evident in how we collaborate with the open-source community, support our customers, and work as a team.

These values aren't just words on a page - they're principles that guide our daily decisions. They've shaped how we approach problems, interact with each other, and serve our customers.

I love feeling aligned with all these values. I believe this alignment is one of the most important elements that will help you thrive in your role.

## Memorable Moments

Some of my most cherished memories include:

- Meeting the Timescale team in person at various conferences and offsites:

After this event, we went to an offsite in Cancun, which was amazing for meeting more team members.

- Our San Francisco offsite in 2023 with Ana and Mel was unforgettable:

Working with Ana and Mel has been one of the highlights of my Timescale journey. Their combined expertise, creativity, and collaborative spirit transform every project into both a success story and a genuinely enjoyable experience.

I'm particularly grateful for Ana's mentorship in communications. As my writing guide and editor, she has an extraordinary ability to illuminate my thoughts and refine my ideas into compelling narratives. Her patient guidance has significantly elevated my communication skills, helping me connect more effectively with our community and stakeholders.
