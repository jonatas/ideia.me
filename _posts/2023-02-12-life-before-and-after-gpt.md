# Life Before and After Chat GPT

As a Developer Advocate, I have to create high-quality content quickly and efficiently. However, before I started using Chat GPT, my workflow was often slow and cumbersome. Coming up with the right words and phrases to convey my ideas was a time-consuming and sometimes challenging process.

I'm not adopting it as a content generator, but as a tool that can boost my
productivity by helping to setup good structure to my content and also provide
me very minimal code examples to use in my content.

## How it has helped me speed up my workflow as a Developer Advocate

Since using Chat GPT, my life has changed dramatically. With Chat GPT's language capabilities, I can generate high-quality content in a matter of seconds, allowing me to focus on the bigger picture and achieve my goals with ease. In this blog post, I'll share my experience of life before and after Chat GPT and how it has helped me speed up my workflow as a Developer Advocate.

ChatGPT has been particularly useful in several situations, such as:

- Writing blog posts: With ChatGPT, I can quickly generate a rough draft of a blog post and refine it later. This has saved me a lot of time and made my writing process much more efficient.

- Creating social media content: ChatGPT has helped me come up with creative and engaging social media posts that resonate with my audience. This has helped me grow my social media following and improve engagement rates.

- Answering technical questions: As a Developer Advocate, I often receive technical questions from my audience. ChatGPT has been incredibly helpful in generating accurate and concise answers to these questions, allowing me to provide a quick response and save time.

## Generating code for technical talks

One of the most significant ways that Chat GPT has helped me as a Developer Advocate is by assisting me in generating code for my technical talks. When presenting to a technical audience, it's essential to have code samples and demos to illustrate your points. However, creating these code samples can be time-consuming and tedious.
With Chat GPT, I can quickly generate code samples and demos in a matter of seconds. This has saved me countless hours and made my technical talks much more engaging and informative. I can simply provide a brief description of what I want the code to do, and Chat GPT will generate a sample that I can then modify and adapt to my specific needs.

Thanks to Chat GPT's ability to understand the context and intent of my descriptions, the generated code is often accurate and concise. It has been a game-changer for me, allowing me to focus on the bigger picture of my technical talks and delivering a more impactful presentation to my audience.


## Creating SQL Training for Data Science

Another way that Chat GPT has been invaluable to me is in helping me create SQL training for data science. As a Developer Advocate, it's crucial to create content that is both engaging and informative, especially when teaching technical skills to a junior audience.

With Chat GPT, I can quickly generate outlines and summaries for my SQL training courses that ensure I cover all the essential topics and don't forget any interesting or important aspects. I can provide a brief description of what I want to cover, and Chat GPT will generate an outline that I can then modify and adapt to my specific needs.

Thanks to Chat GPT's language capabilities, the generated outline is often accurate and well-structured, allowing me to focus on the key concepts of SQL for data science and creating content that is both engaging and informative for a junior audience. This has saved me a lot of time and ensured that my training courses are comprehensive and cover all the necessary aspects.

If you're a Developer Advocate looking to create comprehensive training courses for technical skills, I highly recommend giving Chat GPT a try. Its language capabilities can help you create high-quality content quickly and efficiently, ensuring you don't forget any important aspects to your audience.
