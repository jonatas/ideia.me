Title: Self-host or Cloud?
---

My last 4 years living in the country side gave me a few lessons about
infrastructure and make me build a strong mindset about what I want to manage
myself and what I'd like to have as a service.

The driest seasons pushed me to build a resilient water recycling system,
and with a few heavy rains my big repository was full and ready to offer me
the basics some for shower, dishes and clothes.

Well, infrastructure is hard and I expect at least twice in a year to have:

1. broken pipes
2. run out of water and need to pump from the lake
3. break up the water pump
4. some reason the water just does not arrive because the filters are
   outdated and clogued all tap filters.

That's life in the country side, no house insurance. Every time something happens I
got more resilient to water traumas and getting more used to take snakes and
lizards out of my private pond reservoir.

How this philosophical questions matches with the title?

> Data is like water. Systems are just piping streams of data and storing it.

Pure water, juice, no matter what is streaming on your business. You know the
show must go on ;)

Let's think:

* Do your need your own infrastructure? In my case, self-host is the only option (lol to not cry).
* Do you have the skills in your team to support emergencies out of working hours?
* Do you invest on your own infrastructure? How long will last it?

If you said no for one the questions, probably self-host option can save you for
sometime.

This is not a post about Timescale but it's a post about mindset of
understanding what are the limits of your business and choose the option that
will also make your business runs longer.

If your objective is not long term, choose your goals and understand the risks
of each choice.

* How expensive is the learning when app is down?
* What risks your business have when it's down?
* Do your team wants to commit to infra responsibilities?
* Is there training available?

You can build an incredible resilient team for self-host if you can afford it.

Continuing my parallel with my pipes and issues, I never bargained with my
neighbours that are willed to help me during an emergency. It's so hard when
you stuck with very basic needs like water.

It's not about the hourly cost of getting the support, it's about all the side
effects on getting stuck. Losses doesn't limit to time and money, but they can
burn the confidence your customers have in your business too.

Building a transparent business mindset is the first step to reach your
infrastructure goals.

If your business is not affordable enough to get out of self-host, expose it to
your customers, or find a way to let them help you to afford for afford for a 
better infrastructure if they want to raise the bar in the Service Level Agreement, aka SLA.

Cloud services exists to make business iterate faster. Maybe you're still not
that large company investing on Chaos Teams to chase for resilience.
They can afford the learning of the entire team to force resilience as
the nature of the business. It all depends on your company goals, the stage of
the SLA and and how big the company wants to be :)

**Self-host**: You have 100% control over the machine and installs and maintain
all the software.
**Cloud service**: Someone runs it for you. You pay a third party service to run the infrastructure and
focus on your business rather than risking your team to setup specialized infra
for the projects.

My criterias are not rules. I just want to present them as ideas that can open
your mind when you have the influence to help in decisions.

Wearing my teammate hat, I always think I need to proactive build the place I
want to work. Sometimes it also means advocate and bring very intrinsic decisions
back to the table. Self-host or cloud? what would you choose for your cloud and
why?
