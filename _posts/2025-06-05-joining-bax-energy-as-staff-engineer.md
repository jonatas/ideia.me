I'm thrilled to announce that I'm joining Bax Energy as a Staff Engineer! This marks an exciting new chapter in my professional journey, and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.

After an incredible [four-year journey at Timescale](/four-years-at-timescale), where I served as a Developer Advocate and helped build bridges between complex database technologies and developer communities, I'm ready to take on new challenges in the energy sector.

I'm incredibly grateful for the experiences and learnings at Timescale that have prepared me for this role. Working alongside brilliant engineers and architects has taught me invaluable lessons about making complex systems approachable, building robust developer tools, and nurturing technical communities. The mentorship and collaboration with the amazing Timescale team have been instrumental in my growth as an engineer.

BaxEnergy, now part of Yokogawa Electric Corporation, is at the forefront of renewable energy solutions, managing over 140 GW of renewable energy across 40 countries. The company specializes in creating state-of-the-art software solutions for optimizing asset performance in wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, combined cycle, BESS, and green hydrogen technologies. As a Staff Engineer, I'll be leveraging my background in performance optimization, scalable systems, and developer experience to help build the next generation of energy management solutions. The skills I developed while working with time-series data and PostgreSQL at Timescale will be particularly valuable as we work with large-scale energy monitoring and optimization systems.

What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to combine my technical expertise with my passion for impactful solutions. Just as I helped developers leverage the power of time-series data at Timescale, I'll now be working on solutions that help optimize energy usage and contribute to a more sustainable future. BaxEnergy's commitment to creating "Software Solutions for a Greener World" perfectly aligns with my desire to work on technology that makes a meaningful impact on our planet's sustainability.

I'll be sharing more about my journey and experiences as I embark on this new role. Stay tuned for more updates about the technical challenges we'll be tackling and the innovations we'll be building in renewable energy management.

Here's to new beginnings and the exciting road ahead! ðŸš€
