I'm thrilled to announce that I'm joining Bax Energy as a Staff Engineer! This marks an exciting new chapter in my professional journey, and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.

After an incredible [four-year journey at Timescale](/2025/04/15/four-years-at-timescale), where I served as a Developer Advocate and helped build bridges between complex database technologies and developer communities, I'm ready to take on new challenges in the energy sector. My experience in making complex technical concepts accessible, building developer tools, and fostering community engagement has prepared me well for this next step.

Bax Energy is at the forefront of energy solutions, and I'm looking forward to contributing my expertise to help drive innovation and technical excellence in this space. As a Staff Engineer, I'll be leveraging my background in performance optimization, scalable systems, and developer experience to help build the next generation of energy management solutions. The skills I developed while working with time-series data and PostgreSQL at Timescale will be particularly valuable as we work with large-scale energy monitoring and optimization systems.

What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to combine my technical expertise with my passion for impactful solutions. Just as I helped developers harness the power of time-series data at Timescale, I'll now be working on solutions that help optimize energy usage and contribute to a more sustainable future.

I'll be sharing more about my journey and experiences as I embark on this new role. Stay tuned for more updates about the technical challenges we'll be tackling and the innovations we'll be building.

Here's to new beginnings and the exciting road ahead! ðŸš€
