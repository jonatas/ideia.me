We're reaching a new point in our society with new beings. The AI Agents.

They're souless but smart. They're here to help.

They don't have a soul but act as a human. They're here to help.

`\oo/` They're here to help.

They're not humans but they're bringing an entirely new economy. The soulless economy.
A place for several extended souls that humans will never be able to reach by
themselves but will be able to reach with the help of AI Agents.

The soulless economy will be alive by itself, collaborating even when we're
sleeping. The new standards for compliance and regulations will be created as
profit become a reality from creatures that are exploring new ideas.

The human will start his creative process and the AI Agent will help him to reach the
final product. The human will start his research and the AI Agent will help him to
reach the final conclusion. The human will start his business and the AI Agent will
help him to reach the final success.

The machines are going to allow humans to expand mind power, delegating complex
tasks to agents divide and conquer. With no limits, the AI Agents will be able to
relentlessly work on the most complex problems and find the best solutions.

Combining with phisical robots, the experimentation with raw materials and the
engineering of custom solutions will be a reality. The learnings of the AI agents
and experience of the humans will be combined to create new products and services.

The learnings itself will be a new economy. Several new market places will be created
where AI Agents will be able to sell their learnings to other AI Agents. The AI Agents
will resell their learnings to other AI Agents. The humans compile their learnings
where they will be able to sell their learnings to other humans.

A new set of tools will need to be invented to help the humans and AI Agents to
work together. The AI Agents will need to be able to understand the humans and
the humans will need to be able to understand the AI Agents.

Through several attempts, now all tech companies are chasing the same goal.
Integrate  all their assets and create space to support LLMs. The next steps is 
AI Agents will foster new ideas of business and inventions and put humans to
work on the best ideas. That's why the soulless economy is a place where humans
are thinking and AI Agents are working with all human knowledge to create new
products and services. It can accelerate the process of innovation and create
new opportunities for the future.

The questions that remain are: How will the soulless economy be regulated?
How will the soulless economy be taxed? How will the soulless economy be
monitored? How will the soulless economy be controlled?

Agents will be replacing hundreds of working hours from humans and it's not very
clear how the economy will be able to handle this. The soulless economy is a new
advantage for those that are already adopting. It's like a new coin and you can
buy it now or wait for the price to go up.

If you're using agents, you're already ahead of the game. If you're not using
agents, you're already behind. The soulless economy is a new reality and it's
here to stay. It's a new way of doing business and it's a new way of living.

You can be a smart guy and understand how agents can leverage your business or
ignore it and be left behind. The soulless economy is a new reality and it will
smash the old economy.

When I was a kid, I remember some couple from the church donated a barsa - a set
of books - to my family. I remember that I was so excited to read all the books
and my life was merely nothing to do that I remember reading some of the books
twice. I remember that I was so excited to read all the books and my life really
changed reading them all.

Now I feel I can learn new languages or engage on some conversation with AI that
makes me travel to anywhere in the world anytime. So happy to live exactly now
with the knowledge I got into programming. I can't imagine how my life would be
without it. I can't imagine how my life would be without imagining all this new
levels of research and development that I'm living now.

I feel like I'm living in a new world. A world where humans will reach new
levels of potential never seen before.
