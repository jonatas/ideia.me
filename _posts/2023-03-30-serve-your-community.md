Over the past few years, I've been fortunate to receive numerous approvals to speak at conferences and actively participate in various tech communities. However, I often encounter people who struggle to get their speaking proposals accepted. Drawing from my 8 years of experience in submitting proposals, I want to share some insights on how to improve your chances of getting approved.

The key to a successful speaking proposal is to focus on providing value to the community rather than simply sharing what interests you. To accomplish this, consider the following questions as you craft your proposals:

## Assess your reputation and expertise

Before proposing a talk, ask yourself whether you have the necessary expertise and reputation to discuss the topic. Start by giving talks within your workplace, then progress to smaller meetups and eventually larger conferences.

## Understand your community's needs

To create a talk that resonates with your community, you need to understand their needs and preferences. One way to do this is by participating in the proposal review process for conferences. This will help you see firsthand the challenges faced by reviewers in selecting talks that provide a mix of inclusivity, instruction, and inspiration.

## Cater to different skill levels

An inclusive talk should cater to all skill levels, from beginners to experts. Beginners often need the most support, making them an ideal audience for speakers who are new to public speaking.

## Share valuable knowledge

Aim to provide new knowledge that your audience can apply in their own lives. Consider sharing personal experiences, tips, and tricks that have brought you excitement and success.

## Inspire and energize your audience

Keynote speakers typically set the tone for a conference, so focus on bringing energy and inspiration to your presentation. The more you rehearse and refine your communication objectives, the better equipped you'll be to inspire your audience.

## Ask yourself key questions

Reflect on the following questions to validate your proposal:

- Does the audience need my talk?
- Is my topic relevant to the audience?
- Who am I hoping to inspire with my proposal?
- What is the outcome for the community?
- What will the audience be able to do after my presentation?

Developing your own questions can also help ensure your talk is relevant and meaningful.

## Refine your objectives

Be clear about why you want to speak and what you hope to achieve. Creating strong arguments to support your speaking goals will help you maintain focus and excitement.

## Develop a preparation framework

Preparing a new talk can take around 60 hours of work, spread over several weeks. Rehearse your talk multiple times, focusing on areas that need improvement, and build an outline to help guide your presentation.

## Be authentic

Remember that public speaking is about connecting with your audience on a human level. Be genuine in your delivery, and avoid trying to be perfect or adhering too strictly to a script.

The most important thing is to keep trying and find what works best for you. Whether you enjoy public speaking or not, remember that giving and receiving are the foundation of a thriving tech community. Embrace the spirit of open source and continue to share your knowledge and experiences with others. Good luck!
