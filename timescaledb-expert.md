## PostgreSQL & TimescaleDB Expertise

Currently working as Staff Engineer at Bax Energy, I bring over 20 years of experience in database optimization and system architecture. As a former Developer Advocate at Timescale, I've developed deep expertise in PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB, specializing in performance tuning, scalability solutions, and time-series data optimization. Check out my [resume](/resume) to learn more about my background and expertise.

You can find my technical content in my [posts on Timescale blog](https://www.timescale.com/blog/author/jonatas) and watch my [latest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFW-JgCdpJ0) videos showing Typescript and Ruby libraries integrated in the ecosystem.
